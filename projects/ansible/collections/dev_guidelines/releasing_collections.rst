Releasing collections
*********************

The collections under the `ansible-collections organization <https://github.com/ansible-collections>`_:

- follow the `semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`_ when releasing
- have publicly available release policy (for example, written in its README or in a dedicated pinned issue)
- have a pinned issue when its release managers inform the community about planned / completed releases (can be combined with the release policy issue mentioned above)
- have releases of the collection tagged in the collection's repository
