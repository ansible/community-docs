Ansible Community Steering Committee
************************************

The Steering Committee’s role is to provide continuity, guidance, and
suggestions to the Ansible, and to ensure delivery of the Ansible
Community package. The Steering Committee should reflect the scope and
breadth of the Ansible Community.

Mission:
========

The Steering Committee helps decide the technical direction of the
Ansible Upstream project and is also responsible for avowal of new
proposals (feature idea, new policy in collection world), new collection
requests, empower contributors, maintainers & reviewers and other
technical aspects regarding inclusion and packaging.

Committee Member Responsibilities:
==================================

The members in the committee handle the below:

- Design policy and procedure for the collection world.
- Review things (collections fornow) for compliance with the policies.

- Ballot on approval changes to policy and new proposals.
- Identify and train individuals from the community who are interested in contributing to Ansible.

*Key: Full name (IRC Nickname)*

-  Currently, all the Steering Committee members are selected based on
   their active contribution to the Ansible Project.
-  In future, the selection process will be based on the election model
   through community.

New Policy/Proposals & Inclusion Requests:
==========================================

Requests regarding new collection inclusion requests should be submitted
to this `GitHub
discussion <https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible-inclusion/discussions/new>`__
and requests regarding new policy/proposals should be submitted through
a new pull request to
`ansible-collections/overview <https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview>`__
GitHub repo.

Also, we earlier used a `Community Working Group Meeting
Agenda <https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/539>`__ to track
agenda topics that needed to be discussed in the weekly Ansible
Community IRC meetings. Now, to categorize each topic separately we’ve
created a new GitHub repo
“`community-topics <https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics>`__”.
If you want to discuss an idea, improvements or submitted new
Policy/Proposals & New Collection Inclusion Requests then create a `new
issue <https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/new>`__
in the `repo <https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics>`__
as a topic, and it’ll be discussed publicly in the weekly IRC meeting.
After every meeting, the meeting minutes/summaries and meeting logs will
be posted to the `original
issue <https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/539>`__.

If you cannot join the meeting or from another time zone then you can
directly use GitHub Discussions feature to discuss your new
proposals/collection inclusion requests and the steering committee will
discuss the final conclusions during the weekly IRC meeting and then
will vote on them.
