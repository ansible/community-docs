Ansible Community Steering Committee
************************************

The Steering Committee’s role is to provide continuity, guidance, and
suggestions to the Ansible community, and to ensure delivery of the Ansible
Community package. The Steering Committee should reflect the scope and
breadth of the Ansible Community.

Mission:
========

The Steering Committee helps decide the technical direction of the
Ansible project and is also responsible for avowal of new
proposals (feature idea, new policy in collection world), new collection
requests, empower contributors, maintainers & reviewers and other
technical aspects regarding inclusion and packaging.

Committee Member Responsibilities:
==================================

The members in the committee handle the below:

- Design policy and procedure for the collection world.
- Review things (collections for now) for compliance with the policies. 
- Help create our deliverables (community.general, community.network, the ``ansible`` tarball, docs website).
- Ballot on approval changes to policy and new proposals.
- Identify and train individuals from the community who are interested in contributing to Ansible.
- Review collections submitted for inclusion in the Ansible package and decide whether include them or not.

New Policy/Proposals & Inclusion Requests:
==========================================

Requests regarding new collection inclusion requests should be submitted
via this `GitHub discussion <https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible-inclusion/discussions/new>`_.

Requests regarding new inclusion policy/proposals should be submitted through a new pull request to `ansible-collections/overview <https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview>`_ GitHub repository.

For topics that need to be discussed, the Steering Committee uses the `community-topics repository <https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics>`_. `IRC/Matrix <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/communication.html#real-time-chat>`_ meeting summaries are posted in the `Community Working Group Meeting Agenda <https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/539>`_ issue.
If you want to discuss an idea that can impact the community, collection best practices, inclusion policy, submitted new Policy/Proposals & New Collection Inclusion Requests or other topics the steering committee is responsible for, create a new issue in the `community-topics repository <https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics>`_ as a discussion topic, and it’ll be discussed asynchronously in the issue itself.

Once the filed issue topic is thorough, the Steering Committee will
discuss the final conclusions and then will vote directly on the issue

Depending on the policy/collection inclusion requests/ideas you propose, as you prepare your proposal you may need to consider requirements pertaining to research involving `Ansible Community Code of Conduct <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/code_of_conduct.html#code-of-conduct>`_, `Ansible Collection Inclusion Checklist <https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/collection_requirements.rst>`_ and `Ansible Community Guide <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/index.html>`_.
